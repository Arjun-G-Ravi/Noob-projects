      "Q: What is this website about?\n",
      "A: This website is about transformer models, a type of neural network in AI that learns context and meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data, and their applications in various fields such as machine learning, language translation, fraud detection, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Summarise the contents on this website\n",
      "A: The website discusses the concept of transformer models in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It explains that transformers are a type of neural network that learn context and meaning by tracking relationships in sequential data, using a technique called attention or self-attention. They are a powerful class of models that have driven significant advances in machine learning and are being used in various applications such as language translation, speech recognition, gene analysis, fraud detection, and more. The article highlights the potential of transformers to revolutionize AI and make significant contributions to various fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is self attention?\n",
      "A: According to the retrieved information, self-attention is a mathematical technique used in transformer models to detect subtle ways even distant data elements in a series influence and depend on each other.\n",
